# basicAPItest

the webpage might not run, as i've not included the express, and body-parser files. 

What I learnt while doing this particular project;
I learnt to get dynamic data from the user input (using body-parser), catch that data using app.post().
I used that query to structure the url, and I'd learnt to get that data using https.get(url, function( ){ ..}
I also learnt to use all parts of API, including authentication, paths, parameters etc.
I also learnt to parse the data that we got back and send it to the browser using express and node.
